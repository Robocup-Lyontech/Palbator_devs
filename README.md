# Palbator_devs
This repository gathers several modules such as a HRIManager which will communicate with a [React application](https://github.com/Robocup-Lyontech/robocup_palbator-hri_js) to display some visual information about the robot state, a voice recognition module (speechToTextPalbator), a speech synthesis module (ttsMimic).
